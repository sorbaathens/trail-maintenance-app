# Trail maintenance app

The idea is a smartphone app that helps trail users contribute to trail maintenance.  This would be accomplished by providing a platform and a system for reporting trail maintenance needs, allowing users to sign up and be assigned trail maintenance tasks, and allow maintenance to be marked as done in a to do list fashion.

An example of the type of functionality that we envision is provided by the Amherst, MA browser based reporting system. http://gis.amherstma.gov/trailreq/

Core features:

+ Ability to have a user management system so all reports are tied to a user account.
+ A map and ability to add reports based on users GPS locatoin.
+ Ability to navigate to where work is needed.
+ Ability to add pictures and other details.
 
Enhanced features:

+ System for tracking trail work hours based on a geofence.
